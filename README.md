# Earl Raven Photography — Custom Website

## Project Overview
This repository contains a custom-built photography website developed for **Earl Raven** (also known as **Sasha DeBenedictis**).

The goal of this project is to create a refined, gallery-style website that presents photography in a calm, editorial, and timeless way. The website uses a monochrome interface (black, white, and gray only), allowing the photographs themselves to be the primary source of color and visual focus.

This project is privately developed and is not intended to be a reusable template or open-source project.

        I am someone who learned to see<br />
        by standing quietly behind the lens.
      </p>

      <p>
        For nearly a decade,<br />
        I have chased light and shadow —<br />
        not to control them,<br />
        but to understand the way they linger,<br />
        the way they reveal meaning when left undisturbed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ACT II -->
    <section class="identity-section identity-body">
      <p>
        I study Film and Moving Image<br />
        to deepen that understanding,<br />
        to explore how moments breathe<br />
        when they are allowed to unfold naturally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photography and motion have become inseparable to me —<br />
        two expressions of the same instinct:<br />
        to observe,<br />
        to frame,<br />
        to remember.
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as quiet experimentation<br />
        has developed into a disciplined practice.<br />
        Through the lens and in post-production,<br />
        I refine atmosphere, composition, and tone,<br />
        shaping images that feel intentional<br />
        without feeling constructed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Much of my work is informed by the natural world —<br />
        landscapes, wildlife, and environments<br />
        that demand patience rather than direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        More recently, my work has expanded<br />
        to include people and shared moments,<br />
        where trust, timing, and presence<br />
        matter just as much as technical precision.
      </p>

      <p class="short">
        These images are not conclusions.<br />
        They are evidence<br />
        of a way of seeing.

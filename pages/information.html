      <p>
        I am someone who learned to see by standing quietly behind the lens.
        For nearly a decade, I have chased light and shadow — not to control
        them, but to understand the way they linger, the way they reveal
        meaning when left undisturbed.
      </p>

      <p>
        I study Film and Moving Image to deepen that understanding, to explore
        how moments breathe when they are allowed to unfold naturally.
        Photography and motion have become inseparable to me — two expressions
        of the same instinct to observe, to frame, to remember.
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as quiet experimentation has developed into a disciplined
        practice. Through the lens and in post-production, I refine atmosphere,
        composition, and tone, shaping images that feel intentional without
        feeling constructed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Much of my work is informed by the natural world — landscapes, wildlife,
        and environments that demand patience rather than direction. Alongside
        this, experimental imagery continues to influence the way I approach
        form and mood.
      </p>

      <p>
        More recently, my work has expanded to include documenting people and
        shared moments — where timing, trust, and sensitivity become just as
        essential as technical precision. Each subject offers a different
        challenge, and each one reshapes the way I see the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        But above all, this work is about presence. About waiting long enough
        for something real to surface. About recognizing the moment when
        observation becomes intention.
      </p>

      <p>
        These images are not conclusions. They are evidence of a way of seeing.

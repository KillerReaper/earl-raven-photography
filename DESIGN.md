# DESIGN.md — Earl Raven Photography Website

## Design Purpose
This document defines the **design philosophy, structure, and behavior** of the Earl Raven Photography website.

Its purpose is to ensure the website remains visually consistent, intentional, and aligned with the artistic identity of **Earl Raven (Sasha DeBenedictis)**, regardless of future updates or changes.

This document focuses on **intent and behavior**, not technical implementation.

---

## Core Design Philosophy
- The website should feel like a **gallery or editorial publication**
- The interface should **never compete with the photography**
- Simplicity, spacing, and restraint communicate professionalism
- The website should feel **timeless**, not trendy

The photography is always the primary focus.

---

## Color & Visual Rules
- Website interface uses **black, white, and gray only**
- No accent colors, gradients, or decorative effects
- All color on the site comes from the photographs themselves
- Backgrounds may be light or dark depending on page mood, but always neutral

White space is intentional and used to give images room to breathe.

---

## Typography Direction
- Editorial-style typography
- Serif fonts for headings to convey elegance and artistic tone
- Clean, readable fonts for body text
- Thin to regular font weights
- Generous spacing between text elements

Text should feel calm and confident, never loud or aggressive.

---

## Navigation Philosophy
- Navigation should be minimal and unobtrusive
- Page titles are clear and descriptive
- No unnecessary dropdowns or visual clutter
- Navigation exists to guide, not to dominate the page

---
